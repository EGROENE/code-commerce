This React.js web app is a checkout process on a fictional e-commerce site that sells code components. It consists of a signup/login page, cart page, shipping page, payment page, & confirmation page. I built this using React class components, about which I have been learning in the Devslopes training program. I know functional components are in vogue now, but being able to work with and understand class components still has some value, as many older programs written in React still use this kind of component.

This project involved practicing organizing a React project, styling it (including designing for mobile), as well as lots of prop drilling (sharing state values across multiple components). It was during this project that I came to realize the value of things like Zustand or Redux in managing React State, though I have no experience with these tools whatsoever (yet).

No data entered into input fields is stored in any server from input fields, unless you choose to save info to your browser's autocomplete functionality, as this project is front-end-only.

If you take the time to check out the project in action or read through the code, I would be happy to hear any feedback.
