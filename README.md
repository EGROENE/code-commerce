This React.js web app is a checkout process on a fictional e-commerce site that sells code components, and is my second-ever React project. It consists of 5 parts: a signup/login page, cart page, shipping page, payment page, & confirmation page. I originally built this using React class components, about which I have been learning in the Devslopes training program, but am working now on adding a version of the app that uses functional components.

Since September 23, 2023, I have been working on making several improvements as I have been able to. In previous revisions, I lifted state up as high as possible to prevent extensive prop drilling (I am not using any state-management tools), which led to having a very lengthy parent componenent. After learning more about clean code in React in the past few weeks, I broke up the components with the goal of making the purpose of each component easier to understand, & to contain its logic & functionality.

While working on this project, I have learned more about how to organize a React project, styling it (including designing for mobile), and, originally, lots of prop drilling (sharing state values across multiple components). It was during this project that I came to realize the value of things like Zustand or Redux in managing React State, though I have no experience with these tools whatsoever (yet). I was also able to practice the handling of form inputs (validating input values & displaying error messages, as appropriate).

** No data entered into input fields is stored in any server, unless you choose to save info to your browser's autocomplete functionality, as this project is front-end-only & for practice purposes only. **

To get past the login/signup page to see the rest of the app in action, use 'bruce.twarze@abc.com' as the email & 'Ilikedandelions666#' as the password. You can otherwise go to the signup page & enter data in as it fits requirements in order to advance to the next page. To test a discount code functionality on the cart page, use any of the following: ilikebeachballs, etlb17, devslopes, codeislyfe, jd911.

If you take the time to check out the project in action or read through the code, I would be happy to hear any feedback :)
